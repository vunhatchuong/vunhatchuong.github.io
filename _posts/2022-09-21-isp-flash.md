This post will guide you how to ISP Flash ATmega32u4 with another Pro Micro.

In this guide I will use Arduino Uno as Programmer and Arduino Pro Micro as Target.

## Preface

Before flashing, be sure you have same voltages on both devices, on programmer and on keyboard. So if you have for sample Arduino Uno as programmer, you can program Arduino Pro Micro 5V version, but not 3V!

## Setup the Programmer

So, in this guide we will flash Arduino Pro Micro with ATmega32u4 running on 5V with Arduino Uno as programmer.

1. Install Arduino IDE, for me it's 2.0.0

2. Plug in your programmer to PC, for me it's Arduino Uno

3. Open Arduino IDE, navigate to File > Examples > ArduinoISP > ArduinoISP

4. In Tools > Board > And select your programmer board, for me it's Arduino Uno

5. Press upload button

And now you're done!

## Wire Programmer to Target

When it finish successfully, you have your programmer ready. Now unplug the programmer, grab some wires, and wire the device like this:

- Programmer VCC => Keyboard VCC

- Programmer GND => Keyboard GND

- Programmer MISO (Arduino Uno pin D12) => Keyboard MISO (Arduino Pro Micro Pin 14)

- Programmer MOSI (Arduino Uno pin D11) => Keyboard MOSI (Arduino Pro Micro Pin 16)

- Programmer SCLK (Arduino Uno pin D13) => Keyboard SCLK (Arduino Pro Micro Pin 15)

- Programmer 10 pin (Arduino Uno pin D10) => Keyboard RESET (Arduino Pro Micro pin RST)

You can use a Breadboard if your jumper wires are loose.

### Here are some Diagrams to help you with the process

You can choose to use ICSP interface instead, keep in my it doesn't work for me.

## Burn bootloader into Target

Please be sure to double check that you wire correctly. Now plug the Programmer into PC.

1. Open Arduino IDE.
2. In Tools > Board > And select your programmer board, for me it's Arduino Uno.
3. Change the Board to Arduino Leonard for ATmega32u4.
4. Choose Programmer: "Arduino as ISP(ATmega32u4)".
5. Press Burn Bootloader.

And then you're done, you have ISP flash a Pro Micro with another.

## Resources

- Official [guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/arduino-isp/ArduinoISP) from Arduino.

## Flash Pro Micro with QMK

I will use my Pro Micro to flash QMK for my keyboard.

1. Install QMK Toolbox.
2. Plug your Pro Micro to PC.
3. Install required drivers when told to.
4. Choose a hex file to flash into Pro Micro.
5. Hit reset button or connect GND to RST with tweezer.
6. Hit flash or you can use auto-flash.

And now you have successfully setup a Pro Micro for your keyboard.
