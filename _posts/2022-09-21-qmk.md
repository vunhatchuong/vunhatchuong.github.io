QMK is a firmware uses to configure functionality for your keyboard. This is a collection of things I need to remember about QMK and keyboard configuration.

## Configure with QMK

---

If you want to change keymaps only, you can use VIA/VIAL to do that through a user-friendly interface.

If you want to change anything else including OLED, config you have to setup QMK and build your own firmware.

### Via

>Your keyboard needs to have VIA enabled in `rules.mk`. Most boards will come with this option enable by default. Otherwise, you can find VIA enabled keymap in qmk_firmware [repository](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) and build it yourself.

>On some unoffcially keyboard, you need to have a .json file and load draft definition to be able to use Via.

You can use VIA to change keymaps without flashing.

VIA are hosted on [this](https://www.caniusevia.com/) website. You can also [download](https://github.com/the-via/releases) the software version.

### Vial

> Same as VIA, you also needs VIAL enabled hex files.

VIAL looks like the newer/better version of VIA with have additional features. VIA also doesn't seem to have received any updates since 2020.

You can download it from [here](https://get.vial.today/). Nightly VIAL-enabled hex files are available [here](https://keyboard.gay/).

### Build your own firmware

To setup QMK and build environment, you can follow the Official [guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs) from QMK.

These tools are required to build your firmware and flash your keyboard.
