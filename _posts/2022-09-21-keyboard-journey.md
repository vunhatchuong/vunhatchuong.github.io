This is a blog about my journey in the keyboard hobby and everything I learn along the way.

### Definition

Taken from splitkb docs:

>As the name implies, a split keyboard is a keyboard that is split, often into two halves. You'll have two separate pieces, connected by a cable or wirelessly. Most split keyboards use a TRRS/TRS cable to connect the two halves. The half that you connect to the computer is often called the master, and the half that is connected to the master is in turn called the slave.

### Ergonomic

A split keyboard has the advantage that you can position it in a way that makes you feel comfortable. Often, you'll separate the halves to be at shoulder width, with your arms extending straight forward. This relieves strain from your wrists, since you now won't need to bend your wrists anymore when you type.

### Sofle

Split keyboard is not popular in my country so there's a limited option to choose and I also don't know how to DIY keyboards.

Sofle, especially V1 is the one that catch my eye. You have 2 OLEDs, 2 rotary encoders.
A more comfortable layout for my small hands than Sofle V2.

I bought my Sofle from Kiwikey, unfortunately the knobs color is random and the TRS coil cable is broken so I need to buy a scuff one.

Specs:

- Ocean Dream and Luna OLED.
- Akko Black On White keycaps.
- KTT Strawberry.
- Stacked Acrylic case.

### Corne

Althought Sofle has a lot of functionality, I've always want a small/minimal keyboard. Corne is the pefect one that's available in my country.
